<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Mingus (1922-79), spent much of his life at the top of
the jazz world.  He was prolific; there are many records and I only own a 
handful, but I look forward to exploring the rest.</p>
<p>The idiom is hard-bop, most of the playing fast, stepping out of
the bounds of traditional Western tonality as required, pushing hard at the
boundaries of what was then considered sanity in the arrangements and
ensemble. Some of it goes way out into what was later called “free-jazz”
territory, but Mingus had the wisdom to keep that short and then re-converge
with a bang, so for me, it mostly works, and I have trouble with most free
jazz.</p>
<p>It’s always a small ensemble, something like trumpet/sax/sax/bass/drums/piano.
There are big solos but a lot of the improvisation is collective, with the
players lashing each other higher and higher.  The debt to New Orleans parade
music and black-church gospel is obvious and was freely acknowledged by
Mingus.</p>
<p>He was an angry, sometimes nasty, sometimes violent, man.  Some of it was
political; it was reasonable for a talented black person born in the Twenties
to have spent most of his life angry.  But he went beyond that, sometimes
assaulting people on the stage and in the studio.
Late in life, he collaborated with Joni Mitchell, and on that record (which I
can’t seem to find at the moment) there’s a Mingus soliloquy entitled
<cite>Lucky Man</cite>; given his reputation, it’s oddly sunny and relaxed.
He talks about how life is really shitty for some people, but for himself, he
can’t complain to much; “I always had money to rub together in my pocket” he
explains.</p>
<img src="Mingus-Ah-Um.png" alt="Mingus Ah Um" />
<img src="Mingus-at-Antibes.png" alt="Mingus at Antibes" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>What happened was, sometime in the Seventies, I was in university majoring
in sex, drugs, rock&amp;roll, and left-wing politics, and I heard the
<cite>Antibes</cite> version of <cite>Better Get Hit In Your Soul</cite> very late
on one of those nights before the morning after and my eyes got big as
saucers, “There’s jazz that’s hotter
than Deep Purple?!?”  Well, not much, actually; but Mingus is at the center of
it.</p>
<p>I’ve come to like the studio version of <cite>Better Git Hit In Your
Soul</cite> on <cite>Mingus Ah Um</cite> too, it’s
got most of the energy but there’s more room between the notes, and they
have time to caress them a bit.  Also
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Parlan">Horace Parlan</a>
provides nice light fast piano support.</p>
<p>But the <cite>Antibes</cite> take
discards all that subtlety crap and explores what happens when one
of the great jazz bands of all time puts the pedal right down to the metal and
holds it there for 11:34.  Another description would be “divine madness”.</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote when I listened to it just now:
Bass intro, big loud brass call/response, a
chorus that sounds like schoolyard taunt, a sizzly sax plays alone, then the
band rolls in behind to make it faster and hotter, colourful explosions of atonality,
back to the fast sizzle, the rhythm section goes away and the band claps
behind the saxes, sizzle again, those atonal bits work because the music
is so hot that he just <em>had</em> to explode outside the form, now Mingus is
whooping and chortling into a little drum break, now the band vamps fast
behind
trumpet fireworks from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Curson">Ted Curson</a>, oops, there go the drums again, there’s
the vamp, 
there’s Ted, suddenly we’re listening to Charlie play big piano chords in
front of the drums.  Return to the opening call/response, but they’re shouting
now, and a wrap-up that Tchaikowsky would have been proud of.</p>
<p><cite>Antibes</cite> has two more of these hell-for-leather charges,
<cite>Wednesday Night 
Prayer Meeting</cite> and <cite>Folk Forms</cite>.
A couple of the tracks veer into boring self-indulgence though, the pit that free
jazz is always skating close to the edge of.</p>
<p>On balance, <cite>Ah Um</cite> is maybe the deeper recording, it has the
incandescent <cite>Goodbye Pork Pie Hat</cite>, the studied <cite>Fables of
Faubus</cite>, the slow funk of <cite>Pussy Cat Dues</cite>, the silky
trombone blues of <cite>Jelly Roll</cite>, and pretty well no wasted notes.</p>
<p>The sound quality on both records is pretty wonderful; it’s amazing what
you can accomplish by pointing high-quality electromechanical microphones at a
stage and capturing the output on high-quality magnetic tape.  None of that
digital crap, you know.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>That’d be silly.  Both <cite>Ah Um</cite> and <cite>Antibes</cite> are
superb records that will stretch your mind and have you boppin’.  So go
buy a shiny silver disc or two already.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s another anguished chapter in my relationship with OS X
and its posse.   Baubles already hanging on this chain include
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/16/Back-to-the-Mac">Back to the Mac</a>,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac">Time to Switch?</a>,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/29/Switch">Unswitch</a>.  Weirdly, unless
my logfiles are lying, people like reading them.  Anyhow, I had a
<em>hard</em> crash this afternoon when I unplugged my external screen, and
after OS X came back, both Mail.app and
<a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> had lost their memory.
It turns out NetNewsWire takes a daily backup of your subscriptions (that
Brent Simmons, <em>he da man!</em>) so that only took a couple of minutes to
recover.
But Mail.app, like iCal, seems to think a crash is a good enough reason to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/11/iCal-still-sucks">discard user data</a>; all
my preferences and profiles were gonzo, I had to start from scratch.  It still had my
old POP mail without the account they belonged to, but it’d forgotten about my
Sun IMAP world. 
I got it working again, but then there were some folders I didn’t recognize,
so I deleted them, and now it’s borked again; says “Synchronizing with server”
and never comes back.  So I said the hell with it and now I’m running 
Thunderbird, which ain’t as pretty but seems to work.  I’m still OK with OS X,
but the number of its apps I use is down to Address Book, iTunes, iMovie, and (until the
microsecond I find an alternative) iCal.  Apple makes nice computers and a
good operating system. Aside from movies or music, I’d stay away from the rest
of the apps.  OK, let’s try to be fair: I use computers and applications way
harder than most, and plenty of people are unlikely to push these apps into
breakage. 
And Apple’s mail and calendar and browser and so on are polished and easy to
use.
But I just can’t rely on them any longer.</p>

<p>The Java ecosystem is a news factory these days.  Herewith a few words on
Java SE 6, JRuby 0.9.2, and Groovy 1.0 RC1.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Groovy!</h2>
<p><a href="http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=189">Guillame
Laforge announced</a> Groovy 1.0 RC1.  I’ve been among the skeptical, those
saying “Yeah, Groovy looks cool, but I have real issues about the language
syntax and semantics not having reached 1.0.”  Well, looks like they’re going
to make those issues go away.  Which means we should all have a closer look at
things like
<a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Java!</h2>
<p>They sent me tons of slide-shows and white-papers and so on about all the
cool stuff in Java SE 6, which should be up on 
<a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a> by the time you read this.
I’m not going to try to cover that waterfront.
Java has become so big and so ubiquitous that if you’re somewhere in the
computing biz, something about this release probably touches your life.</p>
<p>The horse’s mouth would in this case be Mark Reinhold’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mr/entry/flashing_past_the_finish">Flashing past
the ﬁnish</a>; check it out.</p>
<p><i>[Update: The
<a href="https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/developer.html">GNU/Linux</a>
distros are ready, same-day; that’s a first.]</i></p>
<p>I’ll mention two issues: performance and support.</p>
<img src="Java-6-perf.png" alt="Performance graph, Java 1.1-6" />
<p>Actual real people I know doing actual real
work that pushes Java to the edge have been making happy noises about the
performance; to a degree greater than that graph would suggest.  It’s hard to
believe that after all these years that there’s much left to squeeze out of
the JVM; you have to be impressed.
<i>[Update: and check
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/11/Java#c1165865048.341140">Martin
Probst</a> in the comments.]</i></p>
<p>I’m no expert on this, but apparently the structure by which you can buy
support for Java apps has been re-built, for example see
<a href="http://www.sun.com/service/javamultiplatform/index.xml">Sun Spectrum
Java Multi Platform</a>.  People have been working terribly hard on this and
expect great things.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>JRuby!</h2>
<p>The JRuby releases come thick &amp; fast these days.
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JRUBY/2006/12/10">JRuby 0.9.2</a> is
another rung in the ladder; they’re closing in on
a bunch of their targets notably including Rails.
These are some of the guys I mentioned in the paragraph above who have been
smiling about Java 6 performance.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>For years, I’ve had two email addresses; the current job and the long-term
personal one.  The latter is unfortunately one of the world’s most public,
appearing among other places on the front of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML specification</a>, and thus gets a
lot of spam.  I mean really a lot.  Which was causing some pretty severe pain,
but I’m using the Gmail dodge, and that helps quite a bit.</p>
<p>Mail client filtering these days is not too bad (except for the penny-stock
scum) but still, the volume (via POP3) was causing problems.  On the ISP side,
if I went offline
for a few days the mail spool would fill up and things would start bouncing.
And on my laptop, everything would get irritatingly sluggish when all the
spam was downloaded and filtered.  Particularly if I’d been offline for a
while, like say two hours.</p>
<p>I was thinking about changing ISPs and server-side filtering and IMAP and so on,
and feeling grumpy about the work, so instead I just redirected all my
personal email to my Gmail account (one tick-box at the ISP).   It works pretty well.</p>
<p>The Gmail spam
filter isn’t perfect but it’s not bad, and it all happens on some big data
farm out there that Google’s paying for; the amount of data that gets pushed
back and forth between my Mac and the Net has been slashed astoundingly, two
or three orders of magnitude, I bet, if I measured it.</p>
<p>Above my inbox is sometimes a little one-liner text ad (can’t complain,
somebody’s gotta be paying for this) and sometimes a little wee news snippet,
apparently driven by a random number
generator.
Hey Google, both the ads and news need some work, I’ve never felt the
slightest urge to click on either.</p>
<p>Also, it’s nice to have search that works; something about my mail backlog
persistently blows up Spotlight.</p>
<p>One nice thing about Gmail is the keyboard shortcuts; my only real gripe is
that there’s no shortcut for “delete”; I’m on all these nicely-archived
mailing lists, for the 90% or so of the messages that I don’t care about, I just
want to make ’em go away, why do I have to click on a button?  There’s a
GreaseMonkey plug-in for this, which <em>might</em> be enough to convert me
from Camino to Firefox.</p>
<p>Amusingly, in a few weeks of doing this, with not that much archived, and
letting Gmail erase the spam and trash after 30 days, I’m using 220MB, or, as
they say “(8%) of your 2792 MB”.  With that kind of volume, it’s astounding
that the Internet is holding together at all.  And, uh, 2792?  Anyone have an
explanation for that number?

<p>You buy it shrink-wrapped in the supermarket, right?  And it’s not bad;
perhaps a slightly guilty pleasure and certainly best enjoyed in moderation.
But you know, that’s not real bacon; somehow, despite having grown up partly
on a farm, until a few weeks ago I’d never tasted the real thing.
On Main Street in Vancouver (which is not and has never been the main street)
at the corner of 20th Ave you’ll find Continental Sausage Co., which I guess
supplies restaurants and has an unpretentious little deli that we’ve started
patronizing.  The meats are in the German style and the ambiance
and pace are definitely of another era.  Anyhow, on impulse one Friday I ordered six
slices of bacon for Sunday breakfast, and she pulled out a big brown slab and
sliced them on the spot.  Oh my goodness gracious, it’s nothing at all
like what the supermarket has.  Now what I <em>do</em> remember from the farm
is fresh eggs, laid in the last day or so.  I wonder where I can find those in
Vancouver?</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of noise these last few days about the Microsoft Office
XML file formats; the world doesn’t need my opinion again.  I’d vaguely noted
that Mac Office would be a little behind on the new XML, then
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> shot me links to a couple
of closer looks, which shed an instructive light.</p>
<p>Andrew Shebanow
<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/shebanation/2006/12/open_xml_one-way.html">does
some numbers</a> based on what we’re hearing and tries to estimate
how many person-years it would take to implement MSOXML; yow!</p>
<p>The impact is that for the next few months, Mac people, just like Linux and
Solaris people and everyone else who doesn’t use Windows, aren’t going to be
able to read Office’s native file format.  That’s OK, Sheridan Jones
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/archive/2006/12/05/converters-coming-free-and-fairly-fast.aspx">suggests
a workaround</a>: “For now, we recommend that Mac users advise their friends
and colleagues using Office 2007 to save their documents as a
‘Word/Excel/PowerPoint 97-2003 Document’ (.doc, .xls, .ppt) to ensure the
documents can be shared across platforms.”  Right, then.</p>
<p>Students of message management will be amused at the conversation launched 
by 
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/">Erik Schwiebert</a> in
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/2006/12/05/conversion-factors/">Conversion
factors</a>.
He dives deep on the Mac Office file-format issues.  One fairly
astounding statement was “there are certainly a variety of XML parsers out
there, including libxml, but the only one that ships on Mac OS by default is
libxml and it doesn’t support everything that the new file formats need.”
Now that’s guaranteed to raise eyebrows in markup-land.
Predictably, the comments got a little heated, and it didn’t help when Erik
added “libxml didn’t handle the latest open standards that the XML spec
details”.   I’m trying hard to find a way to see that as anything other than a
blatant lie, but it’s tough.</p>
<p>Eventually Rick Schaut (who seems like a Real Smart Guy) pulled aside the
curtain of marketing weasel-speak and 
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/2006/12/05/conversion-factors/#comment-5270">laid out</a> the 
actual real engineering issues regarding libxml and MSXML and they’re not
surprising or nefarious; but you rarely see such a nakedly exposed linguistic
framing gradient.</p>
<p>I should close by saying that I’m a huge fan of the MacBU and think that 
Mac Office is probably the single best piece of software that Microsoft ships,
and that I’ll probably end up buying it.</p>

Anyhow I got to watch the huge full moon grow smaller and whiter drifting up,
but in the right place, just south of Oracle, that the planes,
starlike points of white light, were drifting above and below it against the dusk
like fireflies.  And on the talk radio two different right-wingers
saying that even Dubya is a pussy now, America needs to blow up some
more mosques (I’m not making this up) and on another AM station, Christian,
a neo-Calvinist in a slow round cartoon voice: “You may think you

<p>There’s a new thing in the world.  Since I got mixed up in the Web a dozen
years ago, there’ve always been groups of people trying to standardize HTML (at
the IETF, at the W3C, wherever) and as long as I can remember, they’ve been
genially ignored, mostly, by browser makers.
Maybe no longer; it seems that the
<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHAT-WG</a> has broken through and been
noticed.
Mozilla engineer Rob Sayre 
<a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg19192.html">tells</a>
us that WHAT-WG is better than the previous contenders to the
HTML-standardization throne, 
that Firefox has already picked up one piece of their draft-ware, and will
be implementing more.
Meanwhile, Sam Ruby is
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/01/The-White-Pebble">doing
outstanding work</a>, apparently persuading the WHATters of the virtues keeping
what they’re calling “HTML5” somewhat compatible with the rest of the world’s

<p>There’s been something happening recently in my little corner of Wikipedia,
and I don’t know if it’s an anomaly or evidence of a trend; so this is raw
random anecdotal data.  By “my little corner” I mean the small collection
of articles that I track via a recent-changes Atom feed, have contributed to
quite a bit, and feel a little bit of shared responsibility for.  There’s been
a surge of recent editorial activity, with super-energetic (and
apparently well-informed) new contributors trimming and
tweaking and growing the articles, often several times per day.
In general, while I haven’t been convinced that 100% of the changes are
improvements, the quality of the articles as a whole is definitely trending
up.
Also, the random drive-by teenage defacements are getting fixed
<em>really</em> fast.

The proponents are

they have to say is interesting.  I think Gunnar didn’t do a good enough job of

me a link to
<a href="http://www.ebankingsecurity.com/ebanking_bad_for_your_bank_balance.pdf">a
PDF from eBankingSecurity.com</a> which is worth a look.  The point is that a
significant proportion of Windows PCs are compromised with trojans and
keystroke-loggers and other flavors of bad-ware; significant enough that
the pretty-decent transport-level security provided by TLS is immaterial.
Those of us who are technically-competent and don’t use Windows

This is consistent with what
<a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/geir/">Geir Magnusson</a> said in
his (very good) OSCON presentation; that Intel might like to load a
custom JVM with secret code that took advantage of
their inside knowledge of the silicon, so Java would run better on Intel; one
reason they might have preferred Apache to GPL licensing for the Sun Java code.
Me, I’m puzzled.  If there are special instructions to make Java bytecodes (or
.NET CLR code) run fast, uh, how are they going to keep them secret, and why
wouldn’t they end up in <em>every</em> JVM and CLR implementation?
And why wouldn’t this be good for Intel? 
There are disassemblers and so on, you know, and plenty of hackers who are
accomplished at picking apart x86 binaries.
Maybe there’s something else we don’t know.

obvious, looking at the convention floor.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with the candidate videos?  If I were a delegate I’d be pissed; I can
watch the video at home any time; this was the chance to hear them set the air
in vibration with their own lungs; if I were one of them, I’d take every
available minute to talk live.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Second Tier</h2>
<p><i>Martha Hall Findlay</i> She’s sincere, lovable, appealing, but just not
that great a speaker.  The implicit indictment—the only woman on the platform
is a no-hope trailer—is pretty stinging.</p>
<p><i>Scott Brison</i>  A good speaker, handles his voice well, and an
appealing guy.
He turned his
speech into a powerful environmentalist global-warming pitch; not a hard one
to make, these days.  A few enjoyable zingers:  “Quoting Bill Clinton, It’s
the <em>green</em> economy, stupid!”  
He said that green business was potentially another Klondike: “A green rush”.  “What’s
Harper saying about the environment this week?  What did the Bush White House say
last week?”
Maybe he’s got himself a crack at the environment portfolio in some future
Liberal government.</p>
<p><i>Joe Volpe:</i> I could hardly bring myself to listen to this pathetic
hack, and when I did tune in there was nothing there: clichés delivered
without benefit of rhythm or flow. </p>
<p><i>Ken Dryden:</i>  He’s not much of a speaker, his face and voice both slow
and heavy.  I appreciate his attempt at a poetic invocation of Canada,
starting with sunrise in Newfoundland.  And the single best piece of language
construction; his pieces-of-Canada rap veered from exalted and touchy-feely to
gritty and funny, meeting someone down on his luck at 10PM outside Vancouver’s
safe-injection center, who said “Hey, Ken Dryden!  He shoots, he scores!”
(Canadians will know why this is funny.)
He came alive quite a bit on global warming, and had a few good lines:  “We
don’t like the poor being poor”.  “This is a find-a-way world; we’re a
find-a-way country.  The answers aren’t in ideologies.” </p>
<p>And now on to the evening’s big stars.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Stéphane Dion</h2>
<p>His warm-up act, some recently-elected Ontario MP,  banged the
environmental drum; maybe a little too long, since Dion ran out of time.
Dion’s probably my fave candidate just because he’s so smart and strong on the
issues and it’s possible to believe he’s in it largely for reasons of
public-spiritedness.</p>
<p>His good lines were mostly in eloquent French: “There’s more culture in a
bowl of yogurt than the Conservative government.”
“Tories don’t really like government; since we Liberals are compassionate,
we should show them some compassion and run them out of government.”</p>
<p>In English he said “We have a Prime Minister who thinks that child-care is
delivered through the mailbox” and “The
economy and the environment; the people and the planet” and 
“There are three pillars: the market economy, social justice, and the
environment. 
The NDP doesn’t understand the market economy, and the Conservatives don’t
understand social justice.”</p> 
<p>His English is maybe
weak enough to hurt 
his electability; but Lauren said  “His accent’s kind of cute”.</p>
<p>He echoed Brison’s line about there being good money, as well as good
morals, in green business, saying Canada has a chance to be a leader.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Gerard Kennedy</h2>
<p>I hated most of this speech; it was polished polished polished polished;
but mostly just the mouthing of platitudes.  
His real message is “I can win an election” which many say is the core of what
the Liberals are about.  He would be, as he pointed out, 
“the first Liberal leader born and raised in Western Canada;
will not spot the Tories 80 seats west of Kenora.” </p>
<p>In his closing minutes, he came alive
talking about his lengthy food-bank experience (which is a credit to him), and
the general decency of people, given a chance.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Bob Rae</h2>
<p>On the upside, he didn’t have anyone to introduce him, but on the downside,
his video was way too long.  He spoke without a teleprompter, walking free on
stage, which I thought worked well.</p>
<p>His speech was smooth and powerful, with good rhythm.  
But he wasn’t saying that much. </p>
<p>He made a good point along the lines of “Yes, those guys are right about the
environment, but we need to convince Canadians to be green not just in general
but in particular.”</p>
<p>I can’t actually remember much of what he said, but he came across as
grown-up, trustworthy, smart; a safe pair of hands, maybe?   He really should
have spoken more French, though, because when he did, it wasn’t too bad.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Michael Ignatieff</h2>
<p>He’s carrying a ton of baggage because he’s never really lived in Canada as
an adult, but he’s obviously a smart and accomplished guy, and when you’re
hiring a CEO, it’s a good idea to look for someone with connections.</p>
<p>Another overly-long video.
I thought he was great-looking but Lauren was unimpressed.
He had a good opening; “Tonight’s the night the Liberal party begins again”
and his mix of English and French was elegant.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech his words were weirdly slow, but he warmed
up and I thought delivered the sharpest political oratory of the night.</p>
<p>“The party of hope—<i>le parti d’espoir</i>—and hope begins with
opportunity.
Opportunity has to begin with education... we must be the party that says to
every young Canadian who wants to go to college: ‘You get the grades, you get
to go.’”
“We must put a price on pollution and on carbon emission and we will.”</p>
<p>I thought his getting two call-and-responses going, one in French, was
good political theater.  He touched one traditional Liberal button:
“National Unity is the Liberal Party’s most important work; it always has
been and it always will be.” But then stepped outside with “Let’s win some
seats in Alberta.”</p> 
<p>His Tory-bashing was not as effective as the others.  But still, a pretty
good speech.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Results, First Ballot</h2>

<p>Findlay’s dropped from the next ballot and Volpe went to Rae.</p>
<p>What does it mean?  Nobody knows.  Since people think Dion’s speech was
poor, he would have been hurting, except for he managed to squeak past Kennedy
into third place.  Ignatieff significantly under-performed expectations; the
conventional wisdom is that he has little growth potential.</p>
<p>Nobody, <em>nobody</em>, has a useful prediction for the second ballot.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Me, I’d bet on Rae vs. Dion in the last ballot, and think the Liberals
would do OK with either.  But that’s not the key take-away.</p>
<p>What’s important is that this is wonderful, gripping, political theater,
the tired whorish old Liberal party has managed to put on its best clothes and
brightest faces and seem interesting and even intermittently inspiring; they
might convince some people they actually stand for something.
I wouldn’t be surprised if political parties from elsewhere in the world are
watching this with eager attention.</p>

<p>The animation in Web display ads is outta
control, <em>outta control, I tell ya!</em>  They slither and shake and squirm
and flash and jitter and morph and I’m gonna start
bleeding from the eyeballs.  I’ve always eschewed ad-blockers and
Flash-blockers, because advertising <em>should</em> be part of the ecosystem; but
things have gone too far.
Ads in magazines don’t offend me in the slightest, I even enjoy some,
have even been informed about something I might buy.
But on the Web... my instinct tells me that these things not only hurt my
brain, they can hardly be achieving the intended effect. </p>
